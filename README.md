## INSURANCE PREMIUM PREDICTION MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT USING REGRESSION


1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict insurance premiums based on customer data. Weâ€™ll use machine learning regression techniques, as the target variable (charges) is continuous.

2. Dataset

we can use a dataset with features like:
Age: Age of the customer.
BMI: Body Mass Index.
Children: Number of dependents.
Smoker: Whether the customer is a smoker or not.
Region: Customer's region.
charges: Insurance premium (target variable).
you can find a dataset on Kaggle's Medical Cost Personal Dataset

3. Data Preprocessing:

Handle Missing Values: Check for missing data and handle it using appropriate methods like mean imputation or deletion.
Encoding Categorical Data: Convert categorical variables (e.g., smoker, region) into numerical form using techniques like Label encoding and OneHot encoding.
Feature Scaling: Use standard scaling to bring features onto the same scale, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitude.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Feature Relationships: Analyze relationships between features, like age vs. premium or BMI vs. premium.
Visualizations: Use scatter plots, box plots, and histograms to understand feature distributions and outliers.

5. Model Building

Selected suitable regression models, such as:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor (for improved accuracy with larger datasets)

6. Model Training and Evaluation:

Train-Test Split: Divide the data into training and test sets (e.g., 80/20).
Model Training: Train each model using the training data.
Evaluation Metrics: Use evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared to measure model performance.

7. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Used techniques like Grid Search to optimize model hyperparameters.

8. Model Deployment:

Flask : Developed a simple web application where users can input customer data and get premium predictions.
